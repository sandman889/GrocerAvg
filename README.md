Visualization of a dataset given in Kent State's Information VIsualization class, this dataset involves a customer set from various stores. This uses a parallel coordinate system JavaScript library and d3 based operations. The Parallel coordinate library can be found at https://syntagmatic.github.io/parallel-coordinates/# along with some great example code. 

On this site a parallel coordinate graph displays the data found in the JSON data file that is around 5000 entries large. You can then grab the axis and drag them up and down to select a portion to look at. This allows the user to see only the data they want to and really get some good information out of it.
